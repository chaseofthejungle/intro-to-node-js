# Intro to Node.js
  
**Definition/Overview:** Node.js provides developers with an open source and cross-platform (e.g., hardware architectures, operating systems) JavaScript (JS) runtime environment, allowing for the use of JS code (which is ran outside of a web browser, via the V8 JS engine) to perform server-side scripting and create command line based utilities.

A common implementation of Node.js is to have code execute server-side, producing dynamic web page content prior to pages being sent to a client (web browser). Web apps with high scalability and performance obligations (such as HTML web browser games and messaging platforms) benefit from Node.js's asynchronous input/output functionality.
